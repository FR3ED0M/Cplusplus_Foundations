# Cplusplus_Foundations
A number of small program written in C++ to learn how to program in C++.

The skeleton code was given by Professor Bullard of Florida Atlantic University and we had to modify the definitions, headers, and all lines of code that needed to be tweaked. The professor enjoys adding segments of code that aren't needed, or can give us errors, and we as students must make sure to know how to find and test these bugs. 

To solve a puzzle, one must find all the right pieces to build it correctly.
